    "# Intro to Bayesian Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "This week is dedicated to the myriad ways that we can apply Bayes Theorem to estimation and prediction. While Tuesday and Wednesday will focus on how Bayes is applied at scale to Data Science issues, this lesson will focus more on the requisite math and your first introduction to Bayes theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is going to focus primarily on the math and intuition underpinning Bayes and less about the code to deliver those results. If you have a math background, this lesson may serve as more of a review than new material. If you don't, we'll try to be as clear as possible about why we're tackling this material and what you should know about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's main goals are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce Bayes theorem \n",
    "2. Gain enough understanding into probability and combinatorics that we can understand probability distributions (for tomorrow's lesson on Conjugacy in Bayes)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Probability -- how likely is a one (or a series of) events?\n",
    "2. Combinatorics -- from a set of items, how many ways can we arrange them?\n",
    "3. Probability Distributions -- what are the total likelihoods of all outcomes of a given situation? **Note**: this in _essence_ a combination of Probability and Combinatorics\n",
    "    - Probability -- tells us how likely each given outcome is\n",
    "    - Combinatorics -- tells us how many outcomes there are\n",
    "4. Bayes Theorem -- uses probabilities of two related events to give us new information\n",
    "5. Bayes Theorem (in practice) -- _instead of using individual probabilities, use probability distributions for multiple events_\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not going to get to step 5 today. Today is all of the information needed to be ready for tomorrow. "

    "Probability ranges between 0 and 1 -- at 1, the event will occur and at 0, the event will not occur. It is usually denoted this way:\n",

    "$$ p(\\text{rains today}) = 0.25 $$\n",

    "### Combination and Permutation with Replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "We use combinations and permutations with replacement much less frequently than we do cases without replacement. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Permutation with Replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we're asking: \"how many ways can I combine the items in this set, replacing them each time I take one out?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "One example might be the typical magician's card trick: if you choose a card, look at it, and shuffle it back in and draw a second, how many different permutations of cards could you see?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is by far the easiest equation, because we have the same chance to draw a given card in every single draw:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P^R(n, k) = n^k $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, I'm going to draw one of 52 cards the first draw and then I'm going to do it again the **next** time as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P^R(52, 2) = 52^2 = 2,704 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2,704 different sets of cards you could see in this setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: If we wanted to know the likelihood that we would see the *same* card twice by random chance, that would be:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{52} \\cdot \\frac{1}{52} = (\\frac{1}{52})^2 = 0.00037 \\approx 0.037\\%$$\n",
    "which is just 1 divided by the number of possible permutations with replacement. The likelihood is asking \"How likely is one specific instance of this to be?\" while the permutation with replacement is asking \"How many different ways can this be enumerated?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combination with Replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "For combinations with replacement (in other words, how many groups can we make, returning each market (for example) back to the pot, we represent that as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C^R(n, k) = \\frac{(n + k -1)}{k! \\cdot (n-1)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If I was going to randomly choose a market to call on for three different questions, we'd have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C^R(5, 3) = \\frac{(5 + 3 - 1)!}{3! \\cdot (5 - 1)!} = 35 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "35 different pairings, which would include randomly calling on the same market 3 times in a row, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: One benefit of working with combinatorics is that your math looks very excited!"

We know there are 6 combinations of heads or tails with replacement (all heads, all tails, etc.) -- BUT there are many more permutations of 3 heads and 2 tails than there are combinations of 3 heads and 2 tails. We also know there's a certain likelihood of success (for example, if we had a very unfair coin, we still have the same number of possible combinations, it's just that achieving some are much more unlikley than others). \n",

The second part is essentially weighting by the likelihood of getting one result ($p^{\\text{number of success}}$) or the other ($(1-p)^{\\text{number of NOT successes}}$) -- we choose this likelihood!\n",

    "### Worked Example 3 -- The Cookie Challenge\n",

    "- Jar 1 (10 cookies)\n",
    "  - 50% chocolate (5 total cookies)\n",
    "  - 50% vanilla (5 total cookies)\n",

    "  - 75% chocolate (30 total cookies)\n",
    "  - 25% vanilla (10 total cookies)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Let's answer the two questions below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If I take out a vanilla cookie from a jar without telling you which jar, can you estimate the probability of which drawing from jar 2?\n",
    "2. Suppose that we got 1 chocolate and then 1 vanilla cookie. We put each cookie back in the jar after we get it (sampling with replacement). What is the probability we drew from jar 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's figure out what we know:\n",
    "\n",
    "We got a vanilla cookie. To make this easier, we will make $p(D)$ the probability of getting a vanilla cookie in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis $H$, as set above, is that we're pulling from Jar 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p(D) = 0.3$ -- we have 15 vanilla cookies out of a total of 50 cookies.\n",
    "- $p(D|H) = 0.25$ -- if we are actually pulling from jar 2 then we would get have a 25% chance of pulling out a vanilla cookie anyway.\n",
    "- $p(H) = 0.5$ -- the chance that it's actually Jar 2 that we're pulling from. We don't know any better right now, so we'll say that it's 50/50. This is fairly uninformative, leaving us open to be determined one way or the other!\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, pulling out a Vanilla cookie has increased decreased our hypothesis that we are pulling from Jar 2. This makes sense! Even though there are more vanilla cookies overall in Jar 2, if we were pulling from that jar, we have a lower chance of getting a vanilla cookie instead of a chocolate cookie (25% for Jar 2, 50% for Jar 1). Because we got a vanilla cookie, we should believe less in the option where that's a more unlikelyn outcome."
